why am I complaining about ruby?
  - we all know / are learning what is cool about ruby
  - I want to figure out what I am missing vs what is actually a problem 
  - I arbitrarily propose that languages differ more by their cultural problems 
    than by their cool points. (I won't try to prove this).

language:
  - aliased methods (reduce/inject, map/collect, next/succ)
  - too many methods!
    115 string methods
  - no real constants
  - no increment / decrement operators
    probably a feature
  - need to use Proc to pass two blocks to a method.
    (This is why lispers sneer at us)

culture:
  - Those who do not study Unix will be condemned to repeat it!
    insular mindset - ruby infrastructure recreates *nix - not make, apt-get, man
    users shouldn't need to care what language you write in 
    - rake v make
      "Only have to know ruby, not make" - rake a subset of ruby
      But I need make for other things - instead rake is a 2nd dsl to learn
      can be verbose compared to make
      encourages functional / imperative rather than logic
    - rvm / gem / bundle vs *nix package managers
      ignoring PMs generates conflicts (see non-system rubys and readline)
      seems oriented towards programmers (who wish to have many parallel installs)
        vs users (who would like to simply install a package)
    - man pages
      standard gem pattern does install "correctly" (since per-user)
      most gems don't have them
      no infrastructure for them (md2man, etc?)
  - hot comments
    http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HotComments  
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_Document_format
    ruby *has* rd - why are we using comments for documentation?
  - DSL frenzy 
  - Rails is poisonous
    "magic".is_a? Complement
    Rails == ruby
    focus on web-dev leads to... (PM / man page stuff discussed above)
    so many files, the only practical VC is "git add ."
  - Mac-centric
    (core team has done a fine job of keeping things portable)
    blogs seem to always say "brew install" and "System Preferences"
    OS X a fine media and creative platform, but...
    expensive per machine, and frequent hardware upgrades
      (where "frequent" means "more often than every 10 years")
    so not feasible for developing world, or developed world lower class.


count_ruby_methods() {
    # call this function with "String" or "Array", eg

    sed '/^Included Modules/,$d' |\
    sed '/^$/d' |\

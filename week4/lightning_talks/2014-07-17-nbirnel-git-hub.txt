why?
  - speed up repetitive tasks eg adding new repos and forking
  - avoiding switching window focus
  - new possibilities with a scripted interface

how?
the github api
   https://developer.github.com/v3/
   https://developer.github.com/libraries/
  - lots of learning and scripting
  - just fine for one or two commands
git hub
  - comprehensive enough for me, for now
  - rather large (3754 sloc sh, 98 sloc perl, 57 sloc ruby)
  - already written for you!

git hub installation
  git clone git@github.com:ingydotnet/git-hub
  sudo make install
  git hub setup

what am I using?
  - git hub repo-new <repo>
  - git hub fork <owner>/<repo>
  - git hub repo-edit <repo> description

what looks silly?
  - git hub clone <owner>/<repo>
    (This could just be done with git clone, yes?)

what could be interesting?
  forks = `git hub forks --raw UWE-Ruby/AdvancedSummer2014`.split("\n")
  users = forks.map{|f| f.split("/").first}
  n_repos = users.map{|u| `git hub user-get #{u} public_repos`.chomp.to_i}

  def median(array)
    sorted = array.sort
    len = sorted.length
    (sorted[(len - 1) / 2] + sorted[len / 2]) / 2.0
  end

  mean_repos = n_repos.reduce(:+) / users.size.to_f
  median_repos = median n_repos

  ie, what are the mean and median averages
  of the number of github repos per student?

  Ren√©e suggests that she could automate grading homework by pulling down 
  everyone's work and running tests in one fell swoop.

what's the takeaway?
  - Just because there's a web service
    doesn't always mean the browser is the only or best UI for it.
  - switching window focus can mean switching your mental focus
  - As a user: Tools you want are often out there (not just gems!)
  - As a dev: Please make your interfaces scriptable!
      web: RESTful, published api
      cli: no "fluff" in the output
      gui: exposed & published api, or scripting engine - 
        some way of getting at the command underneath the clicks
      You don't know what your users might want to do. Let them find out.

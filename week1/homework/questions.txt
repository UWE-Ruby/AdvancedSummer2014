Read POODR:
  Chapter 1 & 2 - be ready to look at code examples for these principles and discuss

Work on Solitaire exercise

If you haven't already, add file uploads to a rails app using carrierwave

extra credit: Read/skim chapter 3 of Microscope


come prepared with 3 questions or discussion items (can be code related) about the reading and/or exercise

	Can you clarify how we're supposed to turn in the exercises we do for class? For example, for the rails_blog we're working on, do we just include a link to the repository in a pull request?

	Can you do a quick walkthrough of setting up postgres sometime during office hours? I followed the first week's lecture/video step-by-step, but I'm having some trouble getting the login information (username and password) to work correctly. I keep getting error message whenever I try to connect to localhost or create the rails_blog app with postgres.

	On page 10 of POODR, Sandi mentions that there are numerous Ruby gems that help tell you how closely you're following object-oriented design principles. Have you ever used any of these? And if so, do you have any recommendations?

	Can you provide the full syllabus? I'll be working overtime throughout the summer, so knowing in advance which chapters and topics I need to read will help me plan and better use the time I have available.

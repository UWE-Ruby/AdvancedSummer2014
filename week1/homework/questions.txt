Read POODR:
  Chapter 1 & 2 - be ready to look at code examples for these principles and discuss

Work on Solitaire exercise

If you haven't already, add file uploads to a rails app using carrier wave

extra credit: Read/skim chapter 3 of Microscope

come prepared with 3 questions or discussion items (can be code related) about the reading and/or exercise

Questions:

1. I enjoyed reading the part about "Technical debt", and software design. Unfortunately I feel like my current employer is forcing a lot of technical debt onto me. Have you or anyone dealt with employers or clients that push on a lot of technical debt? How did you handle the situation? 

2. Can a program both utilize OOD and procedural elements? 

3. When did OOD begin to take a foot hold in computer programming? How did it come about?

4. In the start of the first chapter the author talked about how many people see the world in a procedural manner. Do you have any thoughts on how to break a person of this habit and look at problems in more of a objected oriented manner?

5. What is declarative programming?

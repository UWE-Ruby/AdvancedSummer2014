The Solitaire Cipher (#1)

Cryptologist Bruce Schneier designed the hand cipher "Solitaire" for Neal Stephenson's book "Cryptonomicon". Created to be the first truly secure hand cipher, Solitaire requires only a deck of cards for the encryption and decryption of messages.

While it's true that Solitaire is easily completed by hand given ample time, using a computer is much quicker and easier. Because of that, Solitaire conversion routines are available in many languages, though I've not yet run across one in Ruby.

This week's quiz is to write a Ruby script that does the encryption and decryption of messages using the Solitaire cipher.

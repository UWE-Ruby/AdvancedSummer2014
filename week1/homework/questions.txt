  Chapter 1 & 2 - be ready to look at code examples 
  for these principles and discuss

Extra credit: Read/skim chapter 3 of Microscope --in-progress
	Waiting for book to arrive from Amazon

Come prepared with 3 questions or discussion items 
(can be code related) about the reading and/or exercise --done

	1. Sandi Metz tells us that agile development promotes 
		 flexible software designs that exactly fulfill the needs 
		 of its client or user. Of the testing frameworks we've 
		 touched on--RSpec, Cucumber, and MiniTest--which would be 
		 best suited for a project that uses agile development?
	2. The first two chapters of POODR included several acronyms 
		 intended to help readers create clean class designs. What do 
		 the following acronyms stand for?
		 			1. DRY
		 			2. SOLID
		 			3. TRUE
		 			4. Bonus: SLOC, OOD, BUFD
	3. Despite the popularity of test-driven development (TDD) 
		 among Rubyists, David Heinemeier Hansson, the creator of 
		 Rails, recently critized what he believes to be its overuse 
		 (http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html). 
		 What side of this argument do you fall on, and 
		 what evidence or experience led you to this opinion?

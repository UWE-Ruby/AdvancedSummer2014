Think about:
  What is coupling between objects (CBO)?
  The objects are dependent on each to perform their intended function.

  How do you find the public interface?
  By creating sequence diagrams

  Where have you coupled objects in previous code for this class? How would you fix it now? Be ready to show this code to the class - it can be a small example.
  I think the rails generators do a good job of minimizing coupling. Looking at my calorie_tracker, I don't see any place I would make changes. The existing coupling is necessary for the application to run properly.

why?
  - speed up repetitive tasks eg adding new repos and forking
  - avoiding switching window focus
  - new possibilities with a scripted interface

how?
the github api
   https://developer.github.com/libraries/
  - lots of learning and scripting
  - just fine for one or two commands
git hub
  - comprehensive enough for me, for now
  - rather large (3754 sloc sh, 98 sloc perl, 57 sloc ruby)
  - already written for you!

git hub installation
  git clone git@github.com:ingydotnet/git-hub
  sudo make install
  git hub setup

what am I using?
  - git hub repo-new <repo>
  - git hub fork <owner>/<repo>
  - git hub repo-edit <repo> description

what looks silly?
  - git hub clone <owner>/<repo>
    (This could just be done with git clone, yes?)

what could be interesting?
  forks = `git hub forks --raw UWE-Ruby/AdvancedSummer2014`.split("\n")
  users = forks.map{|f| f.split("/").first}
  n_repos = users.map{|u| `git hub user-get #{u} public_repos`.chomp.to_i}

  def median(array)
    sorted = array.sort
    len = sorted.length
    (sorted[(len - 1) / 2] + sorted[len / 2]) / 2.0
  end

  mean_repos = n_repos.reduce(:+) / users.size.to_f
  median_repos = median n_repos

  ie, what are the mean and median averages
  of the number of github repos per student?

  Renée suggests that she could automate grading homework by pulling down 
  everyone's work and running tests in one fell swoop.

what's the takeaway?
  - Just because there's a web service
    doesn't always mean the browser is the only or best UI for it.
  - switching window focus can mean switching your mental focus
  - As a user: Tools you want are often out there (not just gems!)
  - As a dev: Please make your interfaces scriptable!
      web: RESTful, published api
      cli: no "fluff" in the output
      gui: exposed & published api, or scripting engine - 
        some way of getting at the command underneath the clicks
      You don't know what your users might want to do. Let them find out.
